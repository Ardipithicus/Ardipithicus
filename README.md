- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ardipithicus
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a relative newbie on both github and blackarch, so please be patient
I have blackarch slim installed on Oracle Virtualbox, however everytime I try to upgrade using -Suy, -Syyu I get the download files but I always get numerous error codes and they do not install
Please tell me where I am going wrong, and don't tell me it's because I shouldn't be on blackarch if I don't know anything
Thank you all inadvance
